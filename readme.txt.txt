MLP VS SVM for pumpkin seed classification


File name and description:

1- Code and test data set - This file includes all the code and test data 

What the file includes:

A. Pumpkin_Seeds_Dataset.xlsx - this contains the dataset

B. Sahan Chowdhury individual project code.ipynb - This is the entire Jupyter notebook code and contains training 

C. Test Set notebook .ipynb - This Is the python file that contains the final models and applies of test data with graphs

D. Pickle files - This contains the saved test sets and models which can be directly used in the test set notebook. The files include final_mlp_model which is the best mlp model, final_svm_model which includes the best svm model . X_test_scaled - which is the x scaled data and Y_test_scaled which contains the y scaled test data. These files will be required if only the test set notebook is run.


Running test set notebook only :

- Ensure all pickle files are there , open test set notebook. Jpynb and run it. 



Running training notebook and test notebook::

- Open Sahan Chowdhury individual project code.ipynb and run it , then open Test Set notebook .ipynb and run for test data
